Getting results from `MCDS.exe`

# `wine`ing

Note that in Windows one can just use `MCDS.exe`. For Linux machines this can be done using `wine`.

For macOS Catalina, this is more complicated because of a lack of 32 bit support in the operating system. One needs to install [this patch](https://github.com/Gcenx/homebrew-wine) of `wine` and use `wine32on64` which allows you to run `MCDS.exe`. This should be edited in the R files as appropriate.
